### My List â€“ Backend (Azure Functions)

This repository contains the backend API for MyList, a cloud-based tasks management application. The backend is built using C# and Azure Functions to provide secure, serverless endpoints for managing user-authenticated task data.

All backend services are deployed to Azure Function App, with automated CI/CD pipelines configured using GitHub Actions to ensure smooth and reliable deployments.
